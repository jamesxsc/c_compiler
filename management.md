# C Compiler Project Management

[//]: # (TODO rearrange this garbage and rename my headers)

# First Steps

## Environment Setup
- CLion
- IDE with debugger, Valgrind, coverage, syntax highlighting; running individual tests quickly
- CMake project
- Testing example.c successfully

## Planning
- It was felt that in order to make an effective plan, it was necessary to work with the codebase for a while to understand it.
- (Stupidly?) decided to try and get mul working first which involved implementing functions, and several layers of the expression AST.
- However, this revealed numerous design decisions that were required that helped the planning process greatly.
  - E.g. the challenges of types and how the structure of the AST types/inheritance affects writing code.
  - What information is required in the Context object.
- Naming consistency - quickly became confusing without adopting a consistent style/approach.

Needs more who did what and collaboration stuff
